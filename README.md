# Risk-Analysis-and-Optimization

This project focused on the meticulous analysis of individual stocks and the strategic optimization of investment portfolios. 
It integrates risk quantification models with fundamental analysis to balance potential returns against risk exposure under real-time financial market data.


## Project Structure

- **[Part 1: Analysis of Individual Stocks](https://github.com/Chloe1123/Risk-Analysis-and-Optimization/tree/main/Task1_Analysis_of_Individual_Stocks)**
  - Dive into stock trends, moving averages, returns, volatility, and comparisons with the S&P 500.

- **[Part 2: Optimization of Investment Portfolio](https://github.com/Chloe1123/Risk-Analysis-and-Optimization/tree/main/Task2_Optimization_of_Investment_Portfolio)**
  - Focuses on maximizing portfolio returns for a specified risk level through methods like Monte Carlo simulation, mean-variance optimization, and MPT principles, incorporating key metrics like VaR, CVaR, and CAPM for nuanced risk assessment.

 ## Key Features

- **Quantitative Risk Analysis**: Implementing VaR and CVaR to estimate potential losses and inform risk-aware investment decisions.
- **Dynamic Portfolio Adjustment**: Using Monte Carlo simulations to anticipate market fluctuations and adjust portfolio strategies accordingly.
- **Optimization Under Uncertainty**: Applying mean-variance optimization and CAPM to navigate the trade-off between risk and return, aiming for the efficient frontier.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Harnessing Python and its powerful libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scipy) for comprehensive financial data analysis and visualization.
