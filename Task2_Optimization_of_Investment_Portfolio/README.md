# Optimization of the Investment Portfolio

## Description
This part  is dedicated to the optimization of the investment portfolio using various quantitative methods. It explores the allocation of assets based on volatility, employs Monte Carlo simulation for risk measurement, and applies mean-variance optimization and Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to achieve the most efficient portfolio.

## Sections
- **Weights Based on Volatility**: Assigns weights to investments in the portfolio based on their volatility, using standard deviation as a primary indicator, to minimize risk. 
- **Risk Measurement with Monte Carlo Simulation**: Uses Monte Carlo simulation to assess the risk of the portfolio under different scenarios, focusing on Value at Risk (VaR) and Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) as key metrics. 
- **Mean-Variance Optimization**: Applies the mean-variance optimization technique, calculation of expected returns, the covariance matrix of asset returns and the Sharpe Ratio, to identify portfolios that offer the best risk-adjusted return.
- **Modern Portfolio Theory, MPT Optimization**: Uses the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) to predict returns from assets' beta, guiding the allocation towards an efficient frontier, to maximize return for a given risk level and reduce unsystematic risk. 
## Objectives
- To enhance portfolio return potential for systematically managing risk using quantitative measures like VaR and CVaR.
- To understand and apply different portfolio optimization techniques and theories
- To assess the portfolioâ€™s risk using simulation methods to construct resilient investment strategies.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python for implementing optimization algorithms and simulations.
- Libraries such as Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scipy for optimization functions.
